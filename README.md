# Ask the Oracle

A random content generator based on [Ironsworn TTRPG](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) by Shawn Tomkin


## About

[Ask the Oracle](https://ask-the-oracle.vercel.app/) is a web app interface for rolling on the tables used to generate story seeds and ideas for Ironsworn. Follow the prompts to select and roll on a content table or "oracle". Once you have received a random result, you may "ask again" to generate another random result. To see the roll table for a given oracle, view the "runic charts". To return to the list of oracles, "seek a different fate".
